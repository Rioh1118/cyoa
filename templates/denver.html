        <h1>Hockey and Ski Slopes</h1>
        
        <p>You arrive in Denver and start your trip by attending a hockey game. The Avalanche had a rough season last year, but your gopher buddy is hopeful that they will do better this year. He also explains that he is tired of hearing about &#34;Two time Stanley Cup champion Phil Kessel.&#34; You suspect that he is still a little salty about the Penguins beating the San Jose Sharks in the Stanley Cup, but you decide to give him a break.<br></p>
        
        <p>The next day you head to the slopes and blaze a few trails. You can definitely see why Denver is called the &#34;Mile-High City&#34;. Gorgeous mountain scenery doesn&#39;t come close to describing it.<br></p>
        
        <p>You consider checking out this GopherCon you have heard so much about, but a quick check on their website has your gopher buddy vetoing it. It turns out he has a strict, &#34;No Space Walks&#34; policy, and refuses to believe that it is just a graphic on the website.<br></p>
        
        <p>The week quickly flies by and before you know it you are packing up to head home.<br></p>
